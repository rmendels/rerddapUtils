\usage{
griddap_split(
  datasetx,
  ...,
  fields = "all",
  stride = 1,
  request_split = NULL,
  fmt = "nc",
  url = rerddap::eurl(),
  store = rerddap::disk(),
  read = TRUE,
  callopts = list(),
  aggregate_file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasetx}{Anything coercable to an object of class info. So the output of a
call to \code{\link{info}}, or a datasetid, which will internally be passed
through \code{\link{info}}}

\item{...}{Dimension arguments. See examples. Can be any 1 or more of the
dimensions for the particular dataset - and the dimensions vary by dataset.
For each dimension, pass in a vector of length two, with min and max value
desired. at least 1 required.}

\item{fields}{(character) Fields to return, in a character vector.}

\item{stride}{(integer) How many values to get. 1 = get every value, 2 = get every other value, etc.
Default: 1 (i.e., get every value)}

\item{request_split}{A numeric vector indicating the number of splits for each dimension, used
to segment the request into manageable chunks. This is particularly useful for large datasets.}

\item{fmt}{(character) One of:
\itemize{
\item nc: save output to a netcdf file
\item memory:  save output in a dataframe in memory
\item duckdb:  save data in a duckdb database
}}

\item{url}{A URL for an ERDDAP server. Default:
https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/ - See \code{\link[rerddap:eurl]{rerddap::eurl()}} for
more information}

\item{store}{ignored}

\item{read}{ignored}

\item{callopts}{Curl options passed on to \code{\link[crul]{verb-GET}}}

\item{aggregate_file}{A string specifying:
\itemize{
\item if is.null(aggregate_file) then a temporary file is created that does not
overwrite user space
\item if "fmt = nc" the path to the NetCDF file to store the results
\item if "fmt = duckdb" the path to the duckdb file to store the results
\item if "fmt = memory" the value is ignored
}}
}
\value{
Varies by format requested:
\itemize{
\item if "fmt = nc" the path to the NetCDF file where the results are stored
\item if "fmt = duckdb" the path to the duckdb file where the results are stored
\item if "fmt = memory" the usual rerddap::griddap dataframe
}
}
\description{
\code{griddap_season} uses the R program 'rerddap::griddap()' to extract environmental data
from an 'ERDDAP' server in an (time, z, y ,x) bounding box where time is restricted to a
given season of the year  (see below).  Arguments are the same as in 'rerddap::griddap()'
except for the added 'season' parameter.  'read' and 'fmt' options are ignored.

out <- rerddap::info('erdQMekm14day')
